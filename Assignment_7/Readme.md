## 🧠 Smart Browsing Memory Agent
A powerful browser extension + server system that turns every page you visit into a searchable memory — both text and images.

## 🚀 Key Features
# 🔄 Automatic Memory Logging: First Chrome Extension
- Every visited URL is logged with:
- Complete HTML content
- Images on the page
- Metadata like URL, title, timestamp

# 🧠 Semantic Indexing (Text + Image)
- Not just keywords — the system understands and stores both what you read and what you saw.

# 🔍 Natural Search over Your Browsing Memory: Second Chrome Extension
Forget standard browser history. Just describe what you remember:

- "That red sneaker product page"
- "The news article with a bar chart on AI"
- "A dark-themed IMDb page about a thriller show"

# 🎯 Precise Recall and Navigation

- Finds the exact visited URL
- Opens it automatically in a new tab
- Scrolls and highlights the exact content — text or image — that matched your query

# 🧩 Built With

# 🎯 Vision
This project is your personal memory system for the internet.
Don't bookmark. Don't scroll through your history.
Just search like a human. The system remembers the rest.
